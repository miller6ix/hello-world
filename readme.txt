Open a text editor. Now write a couple of lines of text, perhaps say hello, and save the file as readme.txt in the 'hello-world' folder you created in the last challenge.

Now add another line to readme.txt and save.

In terminal, you can view the difference between the file now and how it was at your last commit.
